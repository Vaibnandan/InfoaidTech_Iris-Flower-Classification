# InfoaidTech_Iris-Flower-Classification


This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species using machine learning models. The models employed include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forests. The performance of each model is evaluated, with a focus on precision as the primary metric.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: Includes Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for each machine learning model.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and scripts for data preprocessing and evaluation.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the entire classification pipeline.

## Dependencies

Make sure to have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
